            {'\n'}When you use our Platform, we collect and store your
            information which is provided by you from time to time. In general,
            you can browse the Platform without telling us who you are or
            revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us
            your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Where
            possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are
            optional. You always have the option to not provide information by
            choosing not to use a particular service, product or feature on the
            Platform. We may track your buying behaviour, preferences, and other
            information that you choose to provide on our Platform. We use this
            information to do internal research on our users' demographics,
            interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve our
            users. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated
            basis. This information may include the URL that you just came from
            (whether this URL is on our Platform or not), which URL you next go
            to (whether this URL is on our Platform or not), your computer
            browser information, and your IP address. We collect personal
            information (such as email address, delivery address, name, phone
            number, credit card/debit card and other payment instrument details)
            from you when you set up an account or transact with us. While you
            can browse some sections of our Platform without being a registered
            member, certain activities (such as placing an order or consuming
            our online content or services) do require registration. We do use
            your contact information to send you offers based on your previous
            orders and your interests. If you choose to post messages on our
            message boards, chat rooms or other message areas or leave feedback
            or if you use voice commands to shop on the Platform, we will
            collect that information you provide to us. We retain this
            information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer
            support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law. If you send
            us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other
            users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities
            or postings on the Platform, we may collect such information into a
            file specific to you. If you enrol into our SuperCoins Loyalty

            and redeem SuperCoins. We will also collect your information related
            to your transactions on SAPL platform and such third-party business
            partner platforms. When such third-party business partner collects
            your personal information directly from you, you will be governed by
